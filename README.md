# Problem Definition 
With reference to the article, it has been noticed that the growth rate of stroke has been increasing at an alarming rate in Singapore, although stroke has been known to be hereditary, our group believes that there exist various other factors that place an individual at higher risk of getting Stroke.

# Project Objective: 
This project will evaluate which are the highest factors that contributes to stroke itself.

# Models Used
* Logistic regression 
* Random forest classifier
* SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
* ADABoost

# Conclusion
* Based on the findings from logistic regression stroke is mainly driven by age, bmi and average glucose level followed by heart disease. Higher in age, bmi and average glucose level can increase the likelihood of a patient getting stroke
* The risk of stroke is 3 to 4 times higher in the absence of organic heart disease

# What we learn
 * To always do detailed analysis before we draw conclusion
 * Using of SMOTE and ADAboost
 * Making use of multiple algorithm/techniques to analyse our data
